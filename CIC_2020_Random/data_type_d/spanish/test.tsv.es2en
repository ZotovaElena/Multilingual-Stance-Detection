AGAINST	Exhausted Sapoconchus No one wants to do the same thing that they have done. No one has even raised it. The equivalent would be to load the autonomy without modifying the constitution first by relying on a nebula popular will that would not even reach 50% of the vote.
AGAINST	Now that there are no budgets and the details will arrive, I believe that what is appropriate is to open the parliament you approve a salary increase for the government and you close it again another time?
